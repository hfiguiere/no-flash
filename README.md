A Firefox add-on to get rid of Flash video players.

Because there are two things I hate the most on the "web":
* Flash
* EME

## What it does

Will replace know Flash embed with HTML5 equivalent.

* Youtube

* Vimeo: you need H264 support for that since Vimeo has always hated royaltie free codec like WebM
a preferred to tell Firefox users to install Safari, even on Linux.
