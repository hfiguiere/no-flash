Q: Isn't that what Flashblock is doing?

A: No. Flashblock blocks Flash. No Flash tries to replace Flash video playback
with HTML5.

Q: What about that Flash emulator in Javascript?

A: Out of scope. Sorry. I am not emulating Flash. I am just fixing video playback
to use modern technology.

Q: What about Shumway?

A: I believe that most videoplaying shouldn't be emulated by Shumway but rather
switch to HTML5.
