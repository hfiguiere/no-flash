Q: Isn't that what Flashblock is doing?

A: No. Flashblock blocks Flash. No Flash tries to replace Flash video
playback with HTML5.

Q: What about that Flash emulator in Javascript?

A: Out of scope. Sorry. I am not emulating Flash. I am just fixing
video playback to use modern technology.

Q: What about Shumway?

A: I believe that most videoplaying shouldn't be emulated by Shumway
but rather switch to HTML5.

Q: I went to YouTube and didn't see a difference

A: That's because nothing should happen there. It doesn't fix
YouTube. It doesn't make YouTube never use Flash, albeit YouTube is
getting better at that.
