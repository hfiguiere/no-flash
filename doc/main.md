This add-on is meant to replace Flash video player with something in
HTML5.

Whenever possible, we'll replace known Flash embed with HTML5
equivalent. YouTube and Vimeo have been supporting this for a while
now.

In principle this is what Safari on iOS does.

== Add-on Reviewer guide ==

Plans to provide alternative to other known player might happen.
