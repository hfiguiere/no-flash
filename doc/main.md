This add-on is meant to replace Flash video player with something in HTML5.

Whenever possible, we'll replace known Flash embed with HTML5 equivalent. YouTube
and Vimeo have been supporting this for a while now.

Plans to provide alternative to other known player might happen.

In principle this is what Safari on iOS does.
